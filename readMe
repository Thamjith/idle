->final.py - Orginal Source Code

->keygen.py - Generates new Fernet key for Encryption

->decrypter.py - Decrypts te cypher text generated by the script

->dist - contains the obfuscated final.py

->The idle script is designed to work on the Ubuntu OS. I am not aware of its performance in Windows, macOS or any other linux Distributions.

->The source code is protected using pyarmor package.
	Use "pip3 install pyarmor" for installing the package
	Then use "pyarmor obfuscate final.py" to obfuscate the source code of final.py file
	The above step generates a "dist" folder inside which there will be a final.py file with obfuscate code.
	You have to give this entire "dist" folder to the user for the script to work.
	You can run this obfuscated final.py file normally, by running "python3 final.py" on the terminal from the same directory.

->The script now generates a .txt file with idle details in plain text, a .txt file with idle details in cypher text and 
a graph with idle details.

KEY = b'N0oW_ObT2SxvI2wiwBFX0FGjvN70WfAoNIaeksl4t08='

	The cypher text is generated using the above KEY.
	If you want to change the KEY, run the keygen.py, which will generate a random Fernet key.
	Copy the key and paste it on line No.85 inside the paranthesis of Fernet() of python.py(non-obfuscate) and then obfuscate using pyarmor again. 		Also paste the key on line No.5 of decrypter.py
->The cypher text can be decrypted by pasting the entire text on the terminal input when running decrypter.py
