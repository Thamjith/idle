->The idle script is designed to work on the Ubuntu OS. I am not aware of its performance in Windows, macOS or any other linux Distributions.

->The source code needs to be protected by converting to cython so that user wont be able to alter the script to their advantage.

PreRequisites
--------------
pip3 install idle-time
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install pyAesCrypt
sudo apt-get install python-gobject
sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin
sudo apt-get install libnotify-dev

The script now generates a .txt file with idle details in plain text, a .txt file with idle details in cypher text and 
a graph with idle details.
